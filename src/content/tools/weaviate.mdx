Weaviate is a vector database designed to help developers build AI applications like semantic search, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and AI agents. It stores and indexes high-dimensional vector embeddings, allowing you to perform fast similarity searches across unstructured data. Weaviate handles embeddings, ranking, and auto-scaling automatically, so you can focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure. The platform supports various use cases including contextual search, chatbots grounded in your data, and agentic AI workflows.
