Mistral Vibe is a command-line AI coding agent that works directly in your terminal to automate software development tasks using natural language. It can explore, edit, and execute changes across entire codebases with full project awareness by scanning file structures and Git status. The tool handles multi-file refactoring, generates tests and documentation, performs code reviews, and can be extended with custom skills and subagents for specific workflows like deployments or PR reviews.
