LM Studio is a desktop application that lets developers download and run large language models like Llama, Gemma, Qwen, and DeepSeek directly on their computer. It provides a private, offline environment for experimenting with AI models without sending data to the cloud. The tool includes SDKs for JavaScript and Python, an OpenAI-compatible API for easy integration, a command-line interface, and support for various model formats including Apple MLX. It's free to use and designed for both local experimentation and building applications with local AI.
