Milvus is an open-source vector database designed for GenAI and machine learning applications. It stores and manages high-dimensional vector embeddings, enabling developers to perform fast similarity searches on massive datasets. With support for metadata filtering, hybrid search, and multi-vector capabilities, Milvus can scale to tens of billions of vectors with minimal performance loss. It's particularly useful for building recommendation systems, semantic search engines, image retrieval systems, and RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) applications that require efficient vector similarity operations.
