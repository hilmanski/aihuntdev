Langfuse is an open source platform that helps developers build, debug, and monitor LLM applications. It provides observability by tracing all LLM calls and agent actions in your application, making it easy to inspect failures and track costs. The platform includes prompt management with version control, evaluation tools for testing quality, datasets for benchmarking, and a playground for iterating on prompts and model configurations. It integrates seamlessly with popular frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI, and LiteLLM, and can be self-hosted or used as a managed cloud service.
