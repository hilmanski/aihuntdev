Bolt is an AI-powered web development platform that allows users to build full-stack web applications using natural language prompts. Simply describe what you want to create, and Bolt generates the frontend, backend, and database structure in seconds. It runs entirely in the browser using WebContainers technology, enabling you to install packages, run servers, and edit code without any local setup. The platform integrates advanced AI models with a complete development environment, giving AI control over the filesystem, terminal, package manager, and browser console. Bolt supports popular JavaScript frameworks and automatically handles testing, deployment, and hosting, making it accessible for both developers and non-technical users to go from idea to live application quickly.
