AutoGen is a programming framework by Microsoft for building multi-agent AI applications. It provides an event-driven architecture that allows developers to create AI agents that can work together, communicate through asynchronous messages, and solve complex tasks. The framework includes AgentChat for building conversational agents, AutoGen Core for scalable distributed systems, and AutoGen Studio for prototyping multi-agent workflows through a visual interface without writing code. Agents can use language models, execute tools, and collaborate in teams to handle tasks ranging from business process automation to research applications.
