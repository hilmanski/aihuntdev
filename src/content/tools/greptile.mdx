Greptile is an AI-powered code review tool that automatically analyzes pull requests with full understanding of your entire codebase. It provides inline comments identifying bugs, security issues, antipatterns, and performance problems, along with suggested fixes and plain-English summaries. The tool learns from your team's coding standards and feedback over time, helping teams merge PRs up to 4 times faster while catching significantly more issues than traditional code reviews. It integrates directly with GitHub and GitLab, supports 30+ programming languages, and can be deployed in the cloud or self-hosted in your own environment.
