GitBrain is a native Mac application that uses AI to streamline Git workflow management. It automatically splits large code changes into smaller, organized commits with AI-generated commit messages, provides self-code review summaries to help catch issues before committing, and detects your current project from your IDE. The tool integrates keyboard shortcuts for quick Git operations and features a lightweight, floating panel interface that works seamlessly with macOS.
