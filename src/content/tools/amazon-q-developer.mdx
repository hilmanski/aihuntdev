Amazon Q Developer is a generative AI assistant that helps developers throughout the entire software development lifecycle. It provides inline code suggestions in your IDE, can autonomously implement features across multiple files, perform unit testing, generate documentation, and conduct code reviews. The tool includes security scanning to detect vulnerabilities and suggest fixes, supports code transformation for upgrades like Java version migrations, and offers chat capabilities to answer questions about AWS services, your codebase, and best practices. Available as IDE extensions for VS Code, JetBrains, Visual Studio, and in the command line, it supports over 15 programming languages and integrates with the AWS Console.
