Qdrant is an open-source vector database and search engine built in Rust that stores and indexes high-dimensional vector embeddings. It enables developers to build AI applications like semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by providing fast vector similarity search with features like payload filtering, quantization for memory efficiency, and a convenient API. The database integrates with popular embedding models and frameworks, offers both self-hosted and managed cloud deployment options, and is designed to handle billions of vectors with high performance and scalability.
