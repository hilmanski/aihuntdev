Windsurf is an AI-powered integrated development environment (IDE) built as a fork of Visual Studio Code. It features an AI assistant called Cascade that understands your codebase, automatically detects and fixes errors, remembers your workflow context, and can execute terminal commands. The tool offers code generation, autocomplete, multi-file editing across codebases, and integrates custom tools through MCP servers. Windsurf keeps developers in flow by handling boilerplate tasks while supporting multiple AI model providers.
