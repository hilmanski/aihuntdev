Darktrace is an enterprise cybersecurity platform that uses self-learning AI to detect and respond to cyber threats in real-time. It learns what's normal for an organization's network, email, endpoints, cloud, and other infrastructure, then identifies anomalous behavior that signals potential attacks including ransomware, phishing, and zero-day threats. The platform provides autonomous response capabilities to contain threats without manual intervention, and correlates security data across an organization's entire digital ecosystem to provide comprehensive protection.
