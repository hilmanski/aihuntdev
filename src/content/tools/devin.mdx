Devin is an AI coding agent that functions as an autonomous software engineer to help development teams build software faster. It can write code, fix bugs, create pull requests, and implement features based on natural language instructions. Teams can assign tasks to Devin directly through project management tools like Linear or Slack, and it integrates into existing workflows by independently handling tickets, reviewing code, and responding to PR comments. Devin works collaboratively with developers, learning their workflow patterns while clearing backlogs and modernizing codebases.
