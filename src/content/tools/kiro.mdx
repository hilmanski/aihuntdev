Kiro is an agentic IDE and CLI tool built on VS Code that helps developers go from prototype to production through spec-driven development. It converts natural language prompts into detailed technical requirements, design documents, and implementation plans before generating code. The tool features autonomous AI agents that can build features, fix bugs, generate documentation and tests, and automate workflows directly in the terminal. It includes agent hooks that trigger on file events, steering files for project-specific context, and supports multimodal inputs like UI designs and architecture diagrams.
