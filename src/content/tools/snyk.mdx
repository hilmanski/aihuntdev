Snyk is a developer-focused security platform that helps you identify and fix security vulnerabilities across your entire application stack. It scans your custom code, open-source dependencies, container images, and infrastructure-as-code configurations for security issues. Snyk integrates directly into your development workflow through IDE extensions, CLI tools, and CI/CD pipelines, providing real-time security scanning with AI-powered analysis. It offers automated remediation advice and helps developers fix vulnerabilities as they code, rather than discovering issues later in the development cycle.
