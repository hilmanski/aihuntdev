Cursor is an AI-powered code editor built on top of VS Code. It features integrated AI chat, code generation, and intelligent editing capabilities that help developers write and understand code faster. With features like Copilot++, Cursor provides context-aware suggestions and can edit multiple files at once.

Cursor is rolling out two major updates aimed at making it the best place to work with agents: its first in-house coding model, Composer, and a new interface designed for running multiple agents in parallel.

### Introducing Composer

Composer is a frontier-level model that runs about 4× faster than models with comparable capability.

Built for low-latency, agentic coding inside Cursor, Composer completes most turns in under 30 seconds. Early testers reported that the faster iteration loop feels genuinely enjoyable, and they’ve come to rely on it for multi-step coding tasks.
