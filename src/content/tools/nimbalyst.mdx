Nimbalyst is a free local application that serves as an interactive visual editor and session manager designed to work with Claude Code. It allows developers and product teams to iterate on projects by providing a WYSIWYG environment for editing markdown documents, creating HTML mockups, building Mermaid diagrams, and managing AI coding sessions. The tool keeps all project context unified - including specs, diagrams, mockups, and code - allowing Claude Code to access and understand your full codebase while you review, approve, or reject AI-suggested changes. It features session management to tie files to specific AI sessions, making it easy to find and resume work.
