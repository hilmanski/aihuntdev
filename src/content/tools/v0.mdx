v0 is an AI-powered generative UI tool by Vercel that creates production-ready React components and full-stack web applications from simple text descriptions. Users describe what they need in plain English, and v0 generates clean, editable code using React, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. The tool includes an intelligent agent with autonomous capabilities like web search, debugging, and error fixing. Generated code can be customized, exported to GitHub repositories, or deployed directly to Vercel with one click, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and accelerating frontend development workflows.
