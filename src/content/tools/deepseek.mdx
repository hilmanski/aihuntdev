DeepSeek is an AI platform that provides access to powerful large language models through a free chat interface, mobile apps, and developer API. The platform offers multiple AI models including DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 that excel at coding, mathematics, reasoning tasks, and multilingual conversations. Developers can integrate DeepSeek's models into their applications via API, while general users can interact with the AI assistant for tasks like code generation, content creation, document analysis, and problem-solving. The models use efficient Mixture-of-Experts architecture and are released as open-weight, making them accessible for both research and commercial use.
