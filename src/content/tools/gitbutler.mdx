GitButler is a modern Git client that reimagines version control workflows by introducing virtual branches. It allows developers to work on multiple branches at the same time in a single workspace, organizing changes through a drag-and-drop interface similar to a kanban board. You can split your work into different branches on the fly, commit and push them independently, and easily reorder, squash, or amend commits without complex Git commands. It includes AI-powered commit message generation, seamless GitHub integration for managing pull requests, and features like stacked branches and automatic conflict resolution.
