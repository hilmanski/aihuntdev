RunPod is a cloud computing platform that provides on-demand access to GPU-powered servers for AI development. Developers can quickly spin up GPU instances in under a minute to train machine learning models, deploy AI applications, and run inference at scale. The platform supports over 30 different GPU types from high-end B200s to consumer RTX 4090s, with pay-as-you-go pricing billed by the millisecond. RunPod offers both dedicated GPU instances and serverless endpoints that auto-scale based on demand, making it easy to handle everything from model training to production deployment without managing infrastructure.
