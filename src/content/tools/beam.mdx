Beam is a serverless cloud infrastructure platform designed for AI developers to run GPU inference, model training, and containerized sandboxes without managing infrastructure. It provides ultrafast container boot times (under a second), instant autoscaling, and a Python-based interface for deploying AI workloads. Developers can create autoscaling API endpoints for models, run background tasks and job queues, and execute code in remote sandboxes with minimal configuration.
