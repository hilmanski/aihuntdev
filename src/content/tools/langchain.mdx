LangChain is an open-source framework that helps developers build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides a modular platform for creating AI agents, chatbots, and intelligent applications by chaining together components like prompts, memory, vector databases, and external APIs. The framework simplifies connecting to multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and integrating with data sources, making it easier to prototype and deploy production-ready AI applications. LangChain also offers companion products like LangSmith for testing and monitoring, and LangGraph for advanced agent orchestration.
