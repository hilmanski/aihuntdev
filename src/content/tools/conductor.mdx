Conductor is a Mac application that allows developers to run multiple Claude Code AI agents at the same time in separate workspaces. It provides a user interface for managing these coding agents and automatically handles git worktree operations, making it easier to work across multiple repositories and branches simultaneously. The tool integrates with your existing Claude Code login, whether you're using an API key or a Claude Pro/Max subscription plan.
