Resemble AI is a platform that provides AI voice generation and deepfake detection capabilities designed for enterprise use. It allows users to clone realistic AI voices from short audio samples and generate speech using text-to-speech or speech-to-speech in real-time. The platform also offers deepfake detection across audio, video, and images, AI watermarking for content provenance, speaker verification, and security tools to protect against voice fraud and social engineering attacks. Developers can integrate these features using a Python package and API.
