ChatGPT Desktop is a native application for Windows and macOS that brings OpenAI's ChatGPT directly to your computer. It can be accessed instantly from any screen using keyboard shortcuts (Alt + Space on Windows or Option + Space on macOS). The app lets you chat about emails, screenshots, and files, upload documents for analysis, take screenshots to discuss what's on your screen, and use voice mode for hands-free conversations while working. For developers, it integrates with coding applications like VS Code, Xcode, and Terminal, allowing ChatGPT to write edits directly into your IDE. It includes a companion window that stays on top of other applications for easy access while multitasking.
