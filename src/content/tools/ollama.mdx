Ollama allows developers to download and run large language models locally on their own machines without relying on cloud services. It provides a simple command-line interface and API to interact with popular open-source models like Llama, Mistral, Gemma, and DeepSeek. The tool uses quantization to optimize models so they can run efficiently on consumer hardware, offering offline functionality, data privacy, and full customization control. Developers can use it for coding assistance, chatbots, and other AI applications while keeping their data secure on their local devices.
