LlamaIndex is a data framework that helps developers build AI-powered applications using large language models. It specializes in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), allowing you to connect your own data sources like PDFs, databases, or APIs to LLMs without fine-tuning the models. The framework loads and indexes your data into searchable structures, then retrieves relevant information to answer queries. It includes features for building AI agents, parsing complex documents, and integrating with over 300 LLM providers, embedding models, and vector databases through Python and TypeScript SDKs.
