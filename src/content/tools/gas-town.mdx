Gas Town is a CLI-based workspace management system that orchestrates multiple AI agents to work together on coding projects. It provides a structured environment where you can define projects (called 'rigs'), create workspaces for different developers ('crews'), and coordinate AI agents through a 'Mayor' interface that distributes work tasks ('beads') to specialized agents. The system handles agent communication, tracks work state, and manages the entire lifecycle of multi-agent software development workflows.
