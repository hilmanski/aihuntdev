Haystack is an open-source AI orchestration framework that helps developers build production-ready applications powered by large language models. It provides modular, customizable components that can be connected to create pipelines for tasks like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), question answering, document search, and conversational agents. The framework supports integration with multiple AI providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and various vector databases, allowing developers to easily swap components without vendor lock-in. With built-in tools for debugging, monitoring, and deployment, Haystack enables teams to move from prototype to production while maintaining full control over their AI systems.
