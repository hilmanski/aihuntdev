Port is an internal developer portal (IDP) that helps platform engineering teams build autonomous workflows, enforce governance, and enable self-service capabilities across their organization. It uses dynamic blueprints to model software architecture, continuously ingesting and representing the living structure of software systems. The platform provides visibility into engineering metrics, enables policy enforcement, supports multi-domain engineering at scale, and includes features like service catalogs, action dashboards, and workflow automation to accelerate engineering processes.
