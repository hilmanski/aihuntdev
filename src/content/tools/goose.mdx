Goose is an AI agent that runs locally on your machine and can autonomously handle complete development workflows. It goes beyond simple code suggestions by building projects from scratch, writing and executing code, debugging issues, and orchestrating workflows. You can customize it with your preferred AI model and extend its capabilities through built-in or external extensions that connect to tools and APIs. Goose independently manages complex tasks while you maintain full control, keeping all execution on your own computer.
