Lovable is an AI platform that allows users to build complete web applications and websites by describing what they want in natural language. It generates production-ready code using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite for the frontend, with optional backend support through Supabase for databases and authentication. Users can iterate on their projects through chat-based prompts, and the platform provides real editable source code that can be exported to GitHub and deployed to hosting platforms like Netlify. While it excels at rapid prototyping and MVP development, it works best for small to medium complexity projects.
