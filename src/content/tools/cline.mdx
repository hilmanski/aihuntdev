Cline is an open-source AI coding assistant that works as a VS Code extension, capable of autonomously handling complex software development tasks. It can create and edit files, execute terminal commands, browse the web, and interact with your entire development environment with user approval at each step. Cline features distinctive Plan and Act modes - Plan mode allows read-only analysis and strategy development without touching code, while Act mode implements changes. It supports multiple AI providers including Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and local models, and integrates with the Model Context Protocol to extend its capabilities with custom tools.
