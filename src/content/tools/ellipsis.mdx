Ellipsis is an AI teammate that integrates with GitHub to automate code reviews by catching logical mistakes, anti-patterns, and style guide violations. You can assign coding tasks to Ellipsis through GitHub comments and receive working, tested code within minutes. It also answers questions about your codebase, creates release notes, generates weekly summaries of code changes, and learns your team's preferences to customize reviews over time. The tool enforces custom style guides written in natural language and can fix build issues automatically.
