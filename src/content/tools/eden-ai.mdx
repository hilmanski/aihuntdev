Eden AI is a unified API platform that provides developers with access to over 100 AI models from major providers including OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and Microsoft Azure through a single API endpoint. Instead of integrating with multiple AI providers separately, developers can use Eden AI to access various AI capabilities like natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, and text generation. The platform allows you to compare performance across different models, monitor costs with a centralized dashboard, switch between providers instantly, and manage all billing through one invoice.
