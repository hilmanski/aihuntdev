Flowise is an open-source, low-code platform that enables developers to build AI agents and LLM applications using a visual drag-and-drop interface. Built on top of LangChain, it allows you to create everything from simple chatbots to complex multi-agent systems and workflows without extensive coding. The platform provides modular building blocks for orchestrating AI agents, implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, and integrating with various data sources. Flowise includes features for debugging, evaluation, analytics, and deployment, making it easy to take AI projects from prototype to production.
