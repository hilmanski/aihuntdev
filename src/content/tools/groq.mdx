Groq provides an AI inference API called GroqCloud that allows developers to run large language models at exceptionally high speeds using their custom Language Processing Unit (LPU) chips. The LPU is purpose-built hardware designed specifically for AI inference, delivering hundreds of tokens per second with low latency and cost efficiency. Developers can access leading open-source models like Llama through their API, which is compatible with OpenAI's API format for easy integration. The platform is optimized for applications requiring real-time responses and conversational AI experiences.
