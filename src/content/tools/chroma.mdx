Chroma is an open-source vector database designed for AI applications that work with embeddings. It allows developers to store text documents along with metadata, automatically converts text into vector embeddings, and enables similarity search using natural language queries. The database is commonly used for building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems with large language models, providing efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vector data. Chroma offers both a self-hosted option and a cloud service, with simple APIs for Python and JavaScript.
