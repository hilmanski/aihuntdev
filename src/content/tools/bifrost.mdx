Bifrost is a high-performance AI gateway that connects multiple AI providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex, and others through a single OpenAI-compatible API. It provides automatic failover when providers go down, load balancing across multiple API keys, and handles authentication and request routing automatically. Developers can switch between different AI models and providers without changing their code, while getting enterprise features like cost monitoring, rate limiting, semantic caching, and comprehensive observability through Prometheus metrics.
