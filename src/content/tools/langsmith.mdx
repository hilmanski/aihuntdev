LangSmith is a comprehensive platform for building and managing LLM applications that provides complete visibility into AI agent behavior through tracing, monitoring, and debugging capabilities. It helps developers track metrics like costs, latency, and response quality, debug non-deterministic LLM behavior step-by-step, and evaluate application performance over datasets. The platform works with any framework including LangChain and LangGraph, and combines observability, evaluation, deployment, and prompt management features to support the entire development lifecycle from local testing to production.
