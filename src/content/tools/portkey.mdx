Portkey is a production-ready AI gateway platform that helps developers build and manage generative AI applications. It provides a single unified API to access over 1,600 language models from multiple providers, eliminating the need to manage separate integrations. The platform includes built-in features like real-time observability for monitoring LLM behavior, guardrails to prevent harmful outputs and protect sensitive data, prompt management for versioning and A/B testing, and reliability features like automatic fallbacks, caching, and load balancing. Portkey integrates with just a few lines of code and works with popular frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and agent frameworks.
