Pinecone is a serverless vector database designed for AI applications that need to store and search through vector embeddings at scale. It enables developers to build semantic search, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), recommendation systems, and other AI features by efficiently storing and querying billions of vectors with low latency. The platform is fully managed with automatic scaling, supports hybrid search combining dense and sparse embeddings, includes metadata filtering, and integrates with popular AI frameworks like LangChain and OpenAI. Developers can get started quickly with a simple API and free tier.
