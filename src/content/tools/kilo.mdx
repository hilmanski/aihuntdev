Replicate is a cloud platform that allows developers to run open-source machine learning models through a simple API without setting up GPUs or managing infrastructure. It offers thousands of production-ready models for image generation, video creation, audio processing, and more. Developers can use pre-existing models from the community catalog or deploy their own custom models using Cog, an open-source packaging tool. The platform scales automatically based on demand and charges only for actual compute time used, making it easy to integrate AI capabilities into applications without machine learning expertise.
