Graphite is an AI code review platform that helps development teams ship higher quality code faster through stacked pull requests. It provides a unified workflow with a CLI tool and VS Code extension that lets developers create and manage stacks of PRs, allowing them to keep working on new features while other changes are under review. The platform includes features like an integrated inbox for reviewing PRs, automated CI that runs efficiently with stacking, GitHub sync and integration, and AI-powered tools to resolve CI failures and apply suggested fixes directly in the review conversation.
