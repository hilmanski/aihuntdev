CrewAI is a platform that enables developers and enterprises to build and manage teams of AI agents that work together to perform complex tasks autonomously. It offers both a visual editor with AI copilot for non-technical users and a powerful API for developers. The platform allows you to create crews of specialized AI agents that can interact with enterprise applications, use various tools like Gmail, Slack, Salesforce, and HubSpot, and automate workflows with or without writing code. Built on an open-source multi-agent framework, CrewAI includes features like real-time tracing, agent training, and centralized management for scaling AI adoption across organizations.
